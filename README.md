# Counter VHDL - University assignment


This is a VHDL code that implements a 16-bit Counter module. The module also includes additional functionalities such as counting the number of clock pulses and a switch that can change the module's operation from addition to subtraction.

## Functionality

The Counter module performs the following functionalities:

- Adds or subtracts two 16-bit numbers based on the state of the `switch` input.
- Counts the number of clock pulses, up to a maximum of 50, and outputs it to the `ckCounterOut` output.
- Outputs a 9-bit value that represents the current value of the counter to the `mainCounterOut` output. The size of the counter was defined by the project's requirements.
